1. Purchase a Hosting Plan on Hostinger
Sign Up for Hostinger:

Go to Hostinger’s website and choose a hosting plan that suits your needs. Sign up and complete the payment process.
Access Your Hosting Account:

Log in to your Hostinger account.
2. Add Your Domain to Hostinger
Navigate to Domain Management:

Go to the “Domains” or “Manage Domains” section in your Hostinger control panel.
Add Your Domain:

If your domain is already registered elsewhere, you’ll need to add it to Hostinger. Look for an option to “Add Existing Domain” or similar.
3. Update Your Domain’s DNS Settings
You need to update your domain’s DNS settings to point to Hostinger. This is done through the registrar where you purchased your domain.

Get Hostinger’s Name Servers:

In your Hostinger account, find the DNS settings or domain management section. Hostinger will provide you with name servers, which usually look like ns1.hostinger.com and ns2.hostinger.com.
Log In to Your Domain Registrar Account:

Go to the registrar where you purchased your domain (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.).
Update Name Servers:

Navigate to the DNS management or Name Server settings for your domain.
Replace the existing name servers with the ones provided by Hostinger.
Save your changes. DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours, but it often happens much faster.
